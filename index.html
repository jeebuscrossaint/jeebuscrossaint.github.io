                        I am a 17 y/o college student attending Florida Atlantic University currently, 
                        I will graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering and maybe a minor in some 
                        other computer related field (cybersec, ai/ml, cryptology) within the next few 
                        years (probably 2027). <strong>I am currently in the market for an internship</strong>, 
                        and am actively applying to many places.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I am part of and lead the FAU High School Coding Club (currently dual enrolled 
                        will graduate highschool with 73 degree related credits). I am also a member 
                        of the FAU High School Advanced Experimental Vehicles club, where we have built 
                        a solar car from scratch, and are currently racing/building go karts.

                        I am actively doing AI research with a group of 5 others, <em>research grant 
                        funded by Florida Atlantic University Office of Undergraduate Inquiries</em>. 
                        I am an employee of Florida Atlantic University as a Learning Assistant, approved 
                        for the courses Calculus I/II and Precalculus & Trigonometry.

                        I love working on engineering projects, as I know that I will further my career 
                        with them and learn more about the field(s) that I dedicate myself to.

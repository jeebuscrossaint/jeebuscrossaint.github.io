                    <p class="intro">
                        I am an 18-year-old college student attending the University of Central Florida. 
                        I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Photonics 
                        Science & Engineering (or possibly a double major), with potential graduation in 
                        Fall 2027 for a single major or 2028/2029 for a double major. I'm considering a 
                        math minor. <strong>I am currently in the market for an internship</strong> and 
                        am actively applying to many places.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I started at UCF as a freshman with 108 credits, 81 of which transferred in. 
                        I completed AI research with a group of 5 others from August 2024 to March 2025, 
                        <em>funded by a research grant from Florida Atlantic University Office of 
                        Undergraduate Inquiries</em>, where we presented our findings in March 2025.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I previously worked as a Learning Assistant at Florida Atlantic University 
                        (August 2024 - May 2025), approved for Calculus I/II and Precalculus & 
                        Trigonometry courses. I was also involved with the FAU High School Advanced 
                        Experimental Vehicles club, where we built a solar car from scratch and 
                        worked on go-kart projects.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I love working on engineering projects, as I know that I will further my career 
                        with them and learn more about the field(s) that I dedicate myself to.

            <h2>jeebuscrossaint.github.io</h2>
            <p>My premier web development undertaking, learning the core principles of HTML5 and CSS3 I learned website format, layout, and styling along with a slight hint of vanilla javascript.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h2>*Nix .files</h2>
            <p>Less of a project and more of a hobby, I do love using *nix like operating systems and am an avid user of Arch linux, but whenever I get the chance I will switch to gentoo. I also used to use FreeBSD as a daily driver but switched to OpenBSD as a more secure, elegant, and sophisticated alternative. So as time goes by I create configuration (dotfiles) files on my Unix computing journey, and continue to explore even more "esoteric" operating systems such as illumOS and even my own.</p>

            <h2>Choqolah Milk OS</h2>
            <p>A great hobby of mine, learning low level programming such as C/C++ and Assembly are keen interests of mine. As such while at school one day drinking chocolate milk, I thought to myself, why don't I write my own Operating System?</p>

            <h2>Educational AI-Tutor Coach</h2>
            <p>As part of the Qubitx hackathon me and 2 friends have gone in the undertaking of writing an educational ai-tutor that keeps students engaged, thrilled to learn more, and gain real active feedback to improve their learning experience and take their knowledge to the next level. This is also a great project for me to learn the Rust programming language.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Rush Shell</h2>
            <p>As sort of a half joke I decided to learn some Rust on my own and attempt to write a shell in Rust, named the Rust Utility Shell, this shell frankly doesn't do much and cannot be used for scripting purposes YET. I plan to implement that some day.</p>

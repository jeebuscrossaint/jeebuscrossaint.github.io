## Obligatory blurb

I am a 17 y/o college student attending Florida Atlantic University currently, I will graduate with a degree in Computer Engineering and maybe a minor in some other computer related field (cybersec,ai/ml,cryptology) within the next few years (probably 2027). **I am currently in the market for an internship**, and am actively applying to many places. I am part of and lead the FAU High School Coding Club (currently dual enrolled will graduate highschool with 73 degree related credits). I am also a member of the FAU High School Advanced Experimental Vehicles club, where we have built a solar car from scratch, and are currently racing/building go karts. I am actively doing AI research with a group of 5 others, *research grant funded by Florida Atlantic University Office of Undergraduate Inquiries*. I am an employee of Florida Atlantic University as a Learning Assistant, approved for the courses Calculus I/II and Precalculus & Trigonometry. I love working on engineering projects, as I know that I will further my career with them and learn more about the field(s) that I dedicate myself to.

Below you can find some of my projects (docs in progress), my resume, and maybe in the future a blog? I am not sure yet, but I will keep you updated.

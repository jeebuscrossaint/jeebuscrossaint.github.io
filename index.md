As a passionate computer engineering major and high school student right now, I have decided to make many personal projects, most incomplete as of now. Here is the place to read all about them and me. You can click on the titles to read more about each project, or you can scroll down to read about me.

## Projects 
(ordered by how complete they are)

### [Advanced Experimental Vehicles Software](projects/AEV.md)

A full-stack electron application that analysis and controls a made from scratch solar car. The vehicle won "Highest level of Engineering Excellence" presented by Lockheed Martin at the 2024 Solar Car Challenge, along with achieving second place in its class as a first year team. ~4k lines of code.

____

### [Constrict](projects/Constrict.md)

A Go cli tool that is like a simpler version of Make. Not the greatest, but got me into Go. ~300 lines of code.

____

### [Winmatrix](projects/Winmatrix.md)

A fun program like cmatrix but for windows written in rust. Really jank but gets a similar effect done. ~A grand 60 lines of code.

____

### [homeworks](projects/homeworks.md)

A bunch of assortments of homework assignments from my time as a computer engineering student. ~Probably around 2k lines of code at the time of writing.

____

### [dotfiles](projects/dotfiles.md)

My personal dotfiles. I know this isn't really a project, but I have spent a decent bit of time on them, so I am counting it. It is mostly for Linux, (Arch btw) but I have my terminal config for windows too. ~No idea what LOC it is, doesn't really matter.

____

### [Yavafetch](projects/Yavafetch.md)

A javascript (node) program that is a clone of neofetch but for windows. ~A grand 600 lines of code.

____

### [Illuminate](projects/Illuminate.md)

A website I made from a hackathon I did. It is a website for the hackathon, basically the hackathon at least the portion I competed was making a website of the hackathon. ~1k LOC.

____

### [UniUtils](projects/UniUtils.md)

A web app that me and a group of friends made over the course of a year and 2 hackathons. It has 2 parts, a web app that lets a student create a schedule based on what exclusions (say you don't want class on Monday) and a CLI tool called RoomRadar which tells you what rooms are open on campus. ~2k LOC.

____

### [oh-my-gossh](projects/oh-my-gossh.md)

A TUI portfolio that is accessible by running ssh apatel.co (not setup yet) it isn't done yet but most of it is, I just havent had the time to work on it since the start of the semester. ~Probably at most 500 LOC.

____

### [hazmat](projects/hazmat.md)

A CLI password manager written in C++ that is reminiscent of the style of a GNU coreutil/binutil. ~WIP

____

### [mleko-os](projects/mleko-os.md)

A repository of my operating system learning. I made a simple hello world os, and I am working on a more complex one. ~WIP

____

### [KiddieScript](projects/KiddieScript.md)

A compiled programming language that is very work in progress. ~WIP

____

### [weather-app](projects/weather-app.md)

A simple weather app website that I made to learn how to use APIs. ~WIP
